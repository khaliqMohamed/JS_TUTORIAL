// promise --> it has three states which has pending,fulfilled[value],rejected [reason]

// real world example is when we attending the interview then it immediately did not give response of your 
// result. they might be take some time to analyze your interview [this state is called pending
// then they will declare the result either you select[this stste is fulfilled with value]
// or reject [this state is reject with reason]



// creation of promise

const promise = new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
    setTimeout(()=>{
        name:"john";
        resolve("done") // if we didn't put resolve in this line then it shows status is pending bcoz after 1000 millisecond we don't do anything 
        // so if we want to show status is fulfilled then we must called resolve as a function
    },1000)
})

console.log(promise)
//once the time is out then resolve func is called after that then method is called
promise.then((data)=>console.log({result : data}))
